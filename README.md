# Titanic-Data-Visualization-with-Power-BI
I've explored the Titanic dataset using Power BI, creating insightful visualizations that uncover key patterns in the data:

Gender Distribution: Analyzed 448 males and 259 females among the passengers.

Survival Rates: Visualized survival rates, showing outcomes for males (360 not survived, 88 survived) and females (64 not survived, 195 survived).

Embarkation Points: Explored embarkation points and gender ratios at Southampton, Cherbourg, and Queenstown.

Family Size Impact: Investigated how family size (0 to 6 members) affected survival rates.

Age Analysis: Filtered age data (15-60) to better understand survival patterns.

Interactive Dashboard: Built an interactive dashboard with filters for passenger class, gender, and survival status for deeper exploration.
